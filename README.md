=================

Our process for making the world a better place.

Currently this project is in stage 1, genesis -- it is more than just an idea, it is in the process of being born.

Key concepts and vision
-----------------------

  1. iterative improvement.
    1. supporting revolution as well as evolution
  2. complexity management
    1. hierarchy (minimize in-context simultantous concerns)
      1. rule of 7, or rather 5
    2. linear sequence or narrative (local focus, expected route, distant blur)
    3. sops
    4. explicit metrics
    5. analogy
    6. convention and defaults
    7. TODO: Reduce!
  3. the process of managing projects applies recursively to itself.
    1. process improvement is part of every project, including this process.
    2. processes should be living.
      1. self-sustaning
      2. self-correcting
      3. self-replicating
    3. Processes should have both abstract descriptions (interfaces) and concrete descriptions (implementations)
  4. Long term visions and goals are the real projects.
    1. Decompose into mutliple short term projects.
    2. short term projects must succeed before long-term projects can.
    3. the process is not the long term goal.

Stages
-------------
1. **Genesis/Birth**         - What is the idea? Why do anything? What are the apparent benefits, and why do they outway
obvious costs? Is it more than just an idea, worth the effort to flesh out? What is the vision and how does this project
advance long term goals, especially over other things that could be done instead.
2. **Initiation/Infancy**    - What are the initial steps? What is the minimal self-sustaining system?
3. **Growth/Adolesence**     - How do we get to where we want to be? What is the base or architecture on which to build
4. **Maintenance/Adulthood** - How do we know we are done and ready to let this go. How do we enhance the contrinution this project can make.
How do we leverage this project to advance long term goals. Do we need radical change.
If so we should reproduce (fork) to allow separation of concerns.
5. **Deprecation/Senesence** - When is it not worth putting significant effort into this project. Is there something else we shoud recommend instead.
Is anyone using us in a way that advances the goals we care about.
